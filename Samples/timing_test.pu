'add a clock with a specific period
clock clk with period 1
'add some binary trigger
binary "sampling trigger" as trg
'add some state indication
concise state
'and some states
robust signal
' for which, we can define the states in advance (optional)
signal has high,medium,low,zero
'set their initial state
state is Idle

'events can be defined per indicator at specific times
@trg
0 is low
1 is high
5 is low
'indicate some duration
@1 <-> @5 : {40 ms}

' or at specific time point
@0
'and the intial state can be undetermined
signal is {low,zero}
@1
'send a signal
trg -> state : start
state is Sampling
'send a signal with a delay
state -> signal@+0.5

@signal
'indicate some delay
@+0 <-> @+0.5 : {5 ms}

@+0.5
signal is zero

@+0.5
signal is low

@3
signal is medium

@4
signal is high

@5
trg -> state  : stop
state is Reading
state -> signal@+0.5

@5 <-> @+1 : {10 ms}
6 is Idle

@6
state -> signal@+0.5

@+0.5
signal is {low,zero}

@7
state is {hidden}
signal is {hidden}

state is {-}

@10
state is Idle
signal is {low,zero}

@+1
