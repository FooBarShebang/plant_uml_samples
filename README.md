# plant_uml_samples

Set of examples of the different PlantUML diagrams to check your own local installation and to provide the quick remainder on the syntax.

**Note**: these are not tests for the PlantUML itself - the developers team does an amazing job by themselves! These samples are for the checks if your local installation is configured properly, or do you need to install some extra components or to update the already installed ones.

Check the list of the provided [examples](./Samples/index.md).
