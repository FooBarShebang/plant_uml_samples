# plant_uml_samples

Set of examples of the different PlantUML diagrams to check your own local installation and to provide the quick remainder on the syntax.

I have zero experience with YAML and ArchiMate, therefore I copied some examples with minimal changes from other sources, which I cite in the respective scripts. For the other types of the diagrams I tried to create my own, mostly meaningful examples illustrating the major part of the useful functionality. For the pure aestetics such as skin parameters, etc., please, refer to the [official documentation](https://plantuml.com).

**Note**: these are not tests for the PlantUML itself - the developers team does an amazing job! These samples are for the checks if your local installation is configured properly, or do you need to install some extra components or to update the already installed ones.

Here is the link to the [examples](./Samples/index.md).
